# Personal Website (Old)

![](assets/website_old.gif)

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for my old personal website. While it initially seemed appealing to have a homepage showcasing all my social media profiles, I found it to be a bit mundane and cumbersome to manage. The complex JavaScript and overloaded CSS made it challenging to maintain and provide adequate mobile support.

## Transition to Minimalism

In pursuit of a bloat-free lifestyle, I decided to switch to a minimalistic website using Hugo, a static site generator. This shift offers numerous benefits:

- **Ease of Maintenance**: Static website generators like Hugo are straightforward to manage and update.
- **Security**: With fewer moving parts, there are significantly fewer security issues to worry about.
- **Simplicity in Posting**: Creating new posts or updating content is quick and easy, since I just have to write my notes in Markdown.

## Conclusion
Embracing a minimalistic approach has greatly improved my online presence. I encourage others to consider the benefits of static website generators for their own projects.
